// smart_suggestion.js

// This JavaScript file is currently empty as the Smart Suggestion page
// based on the provided wireframe is static and does not require
// any interactive functionality.

// You can add JavaScript here in the future if you implement:
// - Dynamic loading of tips
// - Filtering or searching for tips
// - User interaction with tips (e.g., "like" a tip)
// - Integration with other parts of the application.

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    console.log("Smart Suggestion page loaded.");
    // Any initialization for static content can go here if needed,
    // though typically not for a purely visual replication.
